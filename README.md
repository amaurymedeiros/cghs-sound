Project developed at CGHackspace.

Based on http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/, we did our own tonematrix where the input is kinect's depth detection.

We used two machines: the first one running Windows, to perform sound synthesis; and the other one running Linux, capturing Kinectâ€™s images and processing them in order to build the sound matrix.
